# case
The tasks contain the theme concepts of algorithms by following time complexity. When a code is run by everyone, it follows a certain concept that comes to 
everyone's mind and the code may follow the best case, or they may run on average, but here we are dealing with all types of cases. So, as this repository shows,
even in its worst case, how we deal with the time complexity.
